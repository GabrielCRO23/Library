# Library

This website allows a user to input data through a form and construct multiple instances of a book.

This is my first intermediate-level Javascript project and I used the Odin Project community for guidance and help with writing and understanding the code.

Update 1: Added browser local storage saving for the books to persist even after a page refresh

Update 2: Added remove button to the books

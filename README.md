# Library

This website allows a user to input data through a form and construct multiple saved instances of a book. Though Javascript, the HTML elements are created as the user submits to the form.

This is my first intermediate-level Javascript project and I used the Odin Project community for guidance and help with writing and understanding the code.

Update 1: Added browser local storage saving for the books to persist even after a page refresh or browser restart

Update 2: Added remove button to the books

Update 3: Fixed an error with the "read" or "not read" status of the books not being saved to local storage while everything else was saved
